          High school was a fulfilling and challenging time for me.
          During that time, I continuously explored my potential and
          learned how to make progress together with my classmates. 
          I not only learned knowledge, but also gained friendship 
          and growth. This experience made me more determined to 
          embark on my own path, and also made me full of confidence 
          and expectations for the future.
