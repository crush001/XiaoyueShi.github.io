          High school was a fulfilling and challenging time for me.
          During that time, I continuously explored my potential and
          learned how to make progress together with my classmates. 
          I not only learned knowledge, but also gained friendship 
          and growth. This experience made me more determined to 
          embark on my own path, and also made me full of confidence 
          and expectations for the future.

          College is an important growth stage in my life. 
          I experienced the process from immature to mature, 
          and learned how to face difficulties and challenges,
          how to think independently and solve problems. I firmly 
          believe that these experiences will provide a solid 
          foundation for my future career and life path.
